[Title]: # (Why do kidnappings occur?)
[Order]: # (7)

# Have a plan

The best defence against kidnapping is to have *and practise* a high-quality security management plan. 

Base security management on a thorough understanding of your location:

* General context and risks; 
* The specific threat of kidnapping. 

(Learn about general context and risk assessments in [preparation](umbrella://lesson/preparation).)

Understanding who carries out kidnappings, and why, will help shape your avoidance and survival strategies.

## The main reasons for kidnappings are:

*   To hold for ransom
*   To cause a political effect
*   To achieve publicity
*   To be used as human shields

## The main actors that carry out kidnappings are:

*   Criminals
*   Political extremists
*   Terrorists
*   Militia groups
*   Regimes that use terror

## Factors that may encourage kidnapping:

*   The state's inability to provide protection and prosecute kidnappers;
*   Inadequate political, legal or military response encouraging more actors to become involved;
*   Media coverage of successful kidnap attempts;
*   High financial rewards from kidnapping.
