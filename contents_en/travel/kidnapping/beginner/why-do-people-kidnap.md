[Title]: # (Why do kidnappings occur?)
[Order]: # (7)

# Prevent kidnapping

The best defence against kidnapping is to have *and practise* a high-quality security management plan. 

Base security management on a thorough understanding of your location:

* General context and risks; 
* The specific threat of kidnapping, including:
	*	Past incidents;
    *	Presence of actors that carry out kidnapping;
    *	Factors that may encourage kidnapping.

(Learn about general context and risk assessments in [preparation](umbrella://lesson/preparation).)

Understanding who carries out kidnappings, and why, will help shape your avoidance and survival strategies.

## Kidnappers usually seek:

*   Ransom;
*   Political effect;
*   Publicity;
*   Human shields.

## Actors that mainly carry out kidnappings:

*   Criminals;
*   Political extremists;
*   Terrorists;
*   Militia groups;
*   Regimes that use terror.

## Factors that may encourage kidnapping:

*   The state's inability to provide protection and prosecute kidnappers;
*   Inadequate political, legal or military response encouraging more actors to become involved;
*   Media coverage of successful kidnap attempts;
*   High financial rewards from kidnapping.
