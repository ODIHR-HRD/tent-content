[Title]: # (Make a Plan)
[Order]: # (15)

## Communication

*   Decide whether to negotiate directly with the kidnappers, if that is possible, or appoint an intermediary.

_Using a trusted intermediary gives you time to consider how to respond to messages from the kidnappers, so is often considered preferable._

## Advice

*   Decide whether to call in specialist advice, either from police or from a reputable company specialising in hostage negotiations.  

It may help if contact has been made with such a company before any kidnap occurs.  

_Specialist advice from a reputable company is strongly recommended if you lack expertise._

## Resources

*   Allocate the necessary human, financial and other resources to ensure that your plan has the best possible chance of success,
