[Title]: # (Hate speech)
[Order]: # (0)

Hate speech includes written, spoken or visual discrimination, harassment, threats or violence against a person or group on the basis of their gender, disability, sexual orientation, race, etc.

Any speech that trivialises, glorifies or incites violence against women is hate speech, just as speech that trivialises the Holocaust is anti-semitic and speech that glorifies attacks on people because of their race is racist.

## Hate speech is not free speech

*	People of all backgrounds have a right to use their voices and to express themselves however they want. Hate speech is a violation of this right. 

*	Many of the same people committing such violence are very vocal about their own right to free speech, ignoring how their attacks restrict the free speech of others. 

*	Freedom of expression does not trump freedom from violence. If abuse is expressed in a particularly aggressive, inflammatory or sustained manner, then it may be considered hate speech.
