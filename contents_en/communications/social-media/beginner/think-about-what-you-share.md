[Title]: # (Think about what you share)
[Order]: # (4)

# Before you publish a post, ask yourself:  

## Who can access this?

## Who will control or profit from this?

## Who might share this?

## Who might mind if I share this?

## How much do I trust the companies and users I'm sharing with?

### Remember: 

*	It is easy for someone to copy or share information unintentionally, even people you trust.

*	You can't see everything you're sharing. Every post reveals metadata about you and people you interact with.
