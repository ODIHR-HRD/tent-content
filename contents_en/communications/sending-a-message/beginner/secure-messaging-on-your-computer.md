# Secure messaging on your computer

We recommend one of the following for secure messaging on a computer:

## Pidgin

Pidgin is a secure, free, open source chat program which lets you log in to accounts on multiple chat networks simultaneously. Pidgin runs on Windows, Linux, and other UNIX operating systems. 

Pidgin supports many features of these chat networks, such as file transfers, away messages, emoticons, and typing notifications. Learn how to use it in the [Pidgin tool guide] (umbrella://lesson/pidgin).

## Adium

A good alternative to Pidgin for Mac OS is [Adium](http://adium.im/). 

## Signal Desktop

A desktop version of Signal that runs on Windows, Mac, or LINUX is available [here] (https://signal.org/download/).
