[Title]: # (Web-based proxies)
[Order]: # (7)

A web-based proxy is a website that lets users access other websites. It is one of the simplest ways to circumvent censorship.

Find examples at [proxy.org/](https://proxy.org/).

## To use a proxy:

1. Enter the URL or web address you wish to view on the proxy webpage; 
2. The proxy displays the content.

## What web-based proxies lack:

*	**Security:** Many are insecure, especially if someone is monitoring your connection.
*   **Privacy:** Many record what users do online.
*	**Performance:** Many do not display pages correctly, especially complex websites, audio and video.
*   **Options:** Only work for webpages, not services like email. 

Some proxy tools offer encrypted connections, or at least use HTTPS. 

*Note: these tools do not provide anonymity. The tool may still have access to your personal data.*
