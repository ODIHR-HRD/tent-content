## Psiphon

Psiphon is a secure, public circumvention tool that combines VPN, SSH and HTTP Proxy technology to provide you with uncensored access to Internet content. It is available free online for Windows and Android. You can learn how to use it in the [Psiphon3 tool guide](umbrella://lesson/psiphon).  
Because Psiphon 3 is VPN-based, it is able to proxy all of your Internet traffic, not just websites. It should be noted that although Psiphon does not allow individual user's IP addresses to be associated with any individual website visited, Psiphon is intended primarily as a censorship evasion tool, rather than one that guarantees anonymity.

For information about other VPN services and to figure out which one might be right for you, click [here](http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-services-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2014-edition-140315/). Do not use a VPN that you do not trust.

While a VPN protects your traffic from being intercepted at a number of points such as your internet service provider, your VPN service can still keep logs of what websites you access or even provide a third party with the ability to snoop directly on your web browsing. Depending on your threat model, the possibility of a government listening in on your VPN connection or obtaining the logs may be a significant risk and, for some users, could outweigh the short-term benefits of using a VPN. These users, or anyone who requires total anonymity online, should use Tor, as described in the Advanced section of this lesson.
