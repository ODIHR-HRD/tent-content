Signal is a free, simple, open-source tool for messaging and voice calls with end-to-end encryption.  

Download Signal for: 

*	[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms); 
*	[iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669); 
*	[Desktop] (https://signal.org/download/). 

The person you are communicating with must also install Signal.

# How it works

## Your number is your username. 

*	There are no separate logins, usernames, or passwords to manage or lose. 
*	This makes it easier for you; it could also make it easier to analyze the traffic it produces and trace it back to you. 

## Signal uses a central server. 

*	Signal developers [Open Whisper Systems] operate a central server. You can't run your own, which would give you more control over your security. 
*	However, they cannot hear your conversations or see your messages, so no one else can either. 

## Built-in privacy features.

Signal allows you to set messages to disappear, along with other privacy features.

Learn how to set it up in the Signal tool guides for [Android] (umbrella://lesson/signal-for-android) and [iOS] (umbrella://lesson/signal-for-ios).
