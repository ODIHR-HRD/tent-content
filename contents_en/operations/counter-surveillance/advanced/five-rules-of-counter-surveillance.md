[Title]: # (Five Rules of Counter-Surveillance)
[Order]: # (3)

## 1 is the trigger

The trigger: 
*	Alerts the surveillance team when the target is on the move. 
*	Is the easiest member of the team to identify.

## 10 to 2

*	Your eyeline falls between 10 and 2 on an imaginary clock face. 
*	Surveillance teams try to avoid your eyeline.

## 3 sightings

Look for 3 repeat sightings of the same unexpected person to confirm that you are under surveillance.

## 4 sides, 3 stops

Filter out coincidental sightings.

*	To get from A to B, add C and D to your route to create a 4-sided shape. 
*	Make at least 3 unscheduled stops between A and C, C and D, and D and B.  

## 5 breaks the box

Surveillance teams may surround you by positioning themselves on the corners of an imaginary box. Keeping you in the box makes you easier to follow. 

*	Strike out in an unexpected direction to break the box.
*	Watch for the team to make mistakes while they adapt.
