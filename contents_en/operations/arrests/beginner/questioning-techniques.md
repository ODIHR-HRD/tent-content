[Title]: # (Questioning)
[Order]: # (3)

### Authorities may use established techniques to question you. 

## Questioning techniques

*   Open with trivial questions then shifting to sensitive questions when they started you talking.

*   Threaten, then reducing the threat ("good cop, bad cop").

*   Physical intimidation.

*   Ask the same questions repeatedly or ask you to describe events backwards to test your consistency. 

*   Claim others have made allegations or produced evidence against you. Don't voluntarily confirm what they describe.
