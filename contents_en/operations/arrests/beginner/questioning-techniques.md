[Title]: # (Questioning)
[Order]: # (3)

Authorities may use established techniques to question you.

## Questioning techniques

*   Opening with trivial questions then shifting to sensitive questions when they started you talking.

*   Threatening, then reducing the threat ("good cop, bad cop").

*   Intimidating you.

*   Asking the same questions repeatedly or asking you to describe events backwards to test your consistency. 

*   Claiming others have made allegations or produced evidence against you. Don't voluntarily confirm what they say.

*   Misinterpreting your answers to distort your meaning. Try to check written statements carefully before signing.
