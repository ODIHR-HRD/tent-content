* Inform your boss or editor of the information you obtained so you can evaluate the risk level. Verify the information with colleagues.
* Create an online log to record your movements, and share it with trusted contacts. 
* Keep a log of the different violent episodes you have covered in the past months so there is a record that could provide clues in case of a threat or attack.
* Seek support networks to publish delicate information.
