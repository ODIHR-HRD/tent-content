(Learn more about this in [vehicles](umbrella://lesson/vehicles).)

# Choose a meeting place

*	If participants may be surveillance targets, avoid homes, offices, and frequented locations.  
*	Choose a neutral public place, such as a caf√©. 
*	Choose somewhere easy to fit in.
*	Avoid places known to attract certain groups or people at risk. 
*	Look for images and information online if you can't go in advance.

Consider:

*   Who goes there?
*   What do they wear?
*   What size groups do they sit in?
*   Are tables close together so you might be overheard?
*   Is it likely to be crowded?
*   Will going there attract notice or suspicion?

## Have a backup

Choose an alternative meeting place nearby.

Switch at the last minute if there is a risk of surveillance or if you identify problems at your first meeting place. 

## At the meeting place

*	Sit where you can see the rest of the meeting place;
*	Have your back to a wall; 
*	Sit near the exit or identify an escape route.
