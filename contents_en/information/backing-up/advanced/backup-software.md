# Cobian Backup 

Cobian Backup is a user-friendly tool that can be set to run automatically, at regularly scheduled times, and to include only files that have changed since your last backup. It can also compress backups to make them smaller.

# Bonus backup tips:

*   Organise files. 

Move all folders containing documents to back up into a single location, such as My Documents.

*   See if programs and apps with storage databases will allow you to choose a new storage location. 

If so,  put them in the same folder.

*   Create a regular backup schedule.

*   Establish backup procedures for family and colleagues. 

Help them understand the risk of data loss.

*   Test the process you will use to recover data from your backup. 

Recovery matters more than anything!

* 	Figure out a safe place to store backups. 

This must be different from the original information. Don't keep your a USB stick with work backups in your office!
