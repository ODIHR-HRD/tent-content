# How to make a strong password

A password should be difficult for a computer program to guess, difficult for others to figure out, and should be chosen so as to minimise damage if someone does learn it.

*   **Make it long:** Use more than ten characters, ideally a long phrase or sentence. 

The longer a password is, the longer it takes to guess. Short passwords of any kind, even totally random ones, are not strong enough for use with encryption today.

*   **Make it complex:** Include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols. 

A little effort to make the password more complex goes a very long way. Increasing the length of a password even just by a few characters, or by adding numbers or special characters, makes it much more difficult to crack. Check the strength of passwords at [Passfault](http://www.passfault.com/).

*   **Don't make it personal:** Don't choose a word or phrase based on information such as your name, telephone number, child's name, pet's name, birth date, or anything else that a person could learn by doing a little research about you.

*   **Keep it secret:** Do not share your password or let anyone see you type it. 

If you must share a password, change it to a temporary password first, then change it back when they are done using it. Often, there are alternatives to sharing a password, such as creating a separate account for each individual who needs access. 

*   **Make it unique:** Never use the same password for more than one account. 

Otherwise, anyone who learns that password will gain access to even more of your sensitive information.

*   **Keep it fresh:** Change your password on a regular basis, at least once every three months. 

The longer you keep one password, the more opportunity others have to figure it out and use it.

*   **Make it memorable:**  If you write your password down because you can't remember it, it becomes vulnerable. 

A piece of paper can be seen by anyone with access to your workplace. A computer file like a Microsoft Word document is equally insecure. Even password protected files can be broken in seconds using tools that are freely available on the internet.
