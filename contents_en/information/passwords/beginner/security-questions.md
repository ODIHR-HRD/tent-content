[Title]: # (Security Questions)
[Order]: # (8)

# Security questions are also passwords

*Answering honestly could allow attackers to bypass your password.* 

Many websites use security questions to confirm your identity if you forget your password (such as "What is your mother's maiden name?" or "What was your first pet's name?"). 

The real answers to these questions are often public information, or can be easily found. 

> For example, you or family members may have public posts saying "Here is a photo of our first cat, Spot!" 

## Make up the answers instead

*Give fictional answers that no one knows but you.* 

Instead of using "Spot" as your password recovery answer, you might choose "Rumplestiltskin."
