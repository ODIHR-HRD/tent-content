[Title]: # (Threats of Physical Harm)
[Order]: # (10)

## Hide secret accounts

Attackers can obtain your password by threatening you with physical harm or detention. 

Decide if this is a possibility for you, for example, if you plan to cross a hostile border with sensitive information. (Learn more about assessing your own risk in the [managing information] (umbrella://lesson/managing-information) lesson.)

If so, consider how to hide the existence of the data or device you are protecting with a password.  

Do not trust that you will never hand over the password. 

## Maintain a decoy

If you maintain an account with unimportant information on a computer, email service, or KeePassXC, you can reveal the password without exposing sensitive information.

## Check your device

Your devices are often configured to display your primary account, for example, on your computer login screen, or a tab that loads automatically when you open a web browser.  

If you are hiding an account or using a decoy, reconfigure your device accordingly.
