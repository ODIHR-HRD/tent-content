# Recording passwords securely

You know how to [create a strong, memorable password] (umbrella://lesson/passwords/0). Now you need a different password for every account, and change it every few months. It can soon become difficult to remember them all. Fortunately, there are software tools to help. 

A password manager is a software application that can generate random, secure passwords for each of your accounts and record them in a portable, encrypted password database. One free, open source example is KeePassXC.

The password manager protects all of your passwords with a single master password so you only have to remember one thing. Whenever you need to enter a password for a specific account, you can look it up using your master password. This makes it especially important that you create and remember a very secure master password for whatever tool you choose. 

KeePassXC sits on your desktop. It is also portable, which means that you can put the database on a USB memory stick and look up a password while you are away from your primary computer. You can also use it with a web browser extension to quickly save or auto-fill passwords on the web.

*Note: There are a number of programs with names similar to KeePassXC, like KeePassX, KeePass, and KeePass2. Some of these are based on the same code, while others just use the same database format. [_KeePassXC_](https://keepassxc.org/) is cross-platform and more actively developed.*
