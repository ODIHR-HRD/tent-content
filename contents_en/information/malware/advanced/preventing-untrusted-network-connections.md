# Use a firewall

A firewall helps to: 
* Protect your computer from unauthorised connections to and from the Internet. 
* Reduce the spread of malware if you are infected.  

Most operating systems have firewalls included.

* Check to make sure they are turned on. (You can usually find this under Control Panel > Security.) 
* Use additional firewall software. There are excellent free programs such as [Comodo](https://securityinabox.org/comodofirewall_main) Personal Firewall, which can help keep your computer secure.
* Make sure that all of the computers on your office network have a firewall installed.
