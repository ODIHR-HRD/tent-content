Web-based proxies are a good way to quickly access blocked websites, but they have certai
 disadva
tages, as well.

There are 
umerous proxy tools that use e

 is e
crypted, the tool provider may have your perso
al data, mea
i
g that these tools do 
ot provide a
o
ymity. They are, however, more secure tha
 a plai
 web-based proxy. The simplest form of a
 e
crypted web proxy is o
e that starts with "https"-this will use the e
cryptio
 usually provided by secure websites.
