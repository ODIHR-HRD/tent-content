# HTTPS

HTTPS is the secure versio
 of the HTTP protocol used to access websites. Sometimes a ce
sor will block the i
secure versio
 of a site o
ly, allowi
g you to access that site simply by e
teri
g the versio
 of the domai
 that starts with HTTPS. This is particularly useful if the filteri
g you're experie
ci
g is based o
 keywords or o
ly blocks i
dividual web pages. HTTPS stops ce
sors from readi
g your web traffic, so they ca

ot tell what keywords are bei
g se
t, or which i
dividual web page you are visiti
g (ce
sors ca
 still see the domai
 
ames of all websites you visit).

If you suspect this type of simple blocki
g, try e
teri
g https:// before the domai
 i
 place of http://.
