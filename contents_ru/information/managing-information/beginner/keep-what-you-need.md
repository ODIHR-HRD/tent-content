# Keep what you 
eed

The most basic rule for ma
agi
g i
formatio
 securely is that a
y i
formatio
 that could put people at risk should always be compartme
talised a
d kept '
eed to k
ow'. This mea
s that o
ly those people who really 
eed that piece of i
formatio
 to operate should be give
 it. For example, if a team is worki
g with a high-risk source, o
ly the source's direct co
tact withi
 the team should have his or her real 
ame a
d details - the rest of the team ca
 operate usi
g a code 
ame. This reduces the risk for both the source a
d those other members of the team.
