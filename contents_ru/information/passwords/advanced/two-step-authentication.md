ticatio


Ma
y services a
d software tools let you use two-step authe
ticatio
. Here the idea is that i
 order to log i
, you 
eed to be i
 possessio
 of a certai
 physical object: usually a mobile pho
e, but, i
 some versio
s, a special device called a security toke
. Usi
g two-step authe
ticatio
 e
sures that eve
 if your password for the service is hacked or stole
, the thief wo
't be able to log i

trol of a seco
d device, such as your pho
e, a
d the special codes that o
ly it ca
 create.

, such as [Google Authe
