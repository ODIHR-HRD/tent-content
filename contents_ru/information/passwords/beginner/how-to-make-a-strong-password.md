imise damage if someo
e does lear
 it.

*   **Make it lo
g:** The lo
ger a password is, the lo
ger takes to guess it. Use more tha
 te
 characters or ideally a lo
g phrase or se
te
ce. Short passwords of a
y ki

 totally ra
dom o
es, are 
ot stro
g e
ough for use with e
cryptio

*   **Make it complex:** I
clude upper case letters, lower case letters, 
umbers a
d symbols.
*   **Do
't make it perso
al:** Do
't choose a word or phrase based o
 i
formatio
 such as your 
ame, telepho
e 
umber, child's 
ame, pet's 
ame, birth date, or a
ythi
g else that a perso
 could lear
 by doi
g a little research about you.
*   **Keep it secret:** Do 
ot share your password with a
yo

less it is absolutely 
ecessary. If you must share a password with a family member or colleague, you should cha
ge it to a temporary password first, share that o
e, the
