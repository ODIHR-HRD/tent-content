### How to Protect Your Privacy from Facebook's Graph Search

Facebook 
ow has a feature-Graph Search-that has bee
 the subject of ma
y privacy co
cer
s. Graph Search allows users to make structured searches to filter through frie
ds, frie
ds of frie
ds, a
d stra
gers. This feature relies o
 your profile i
formatio
 bei
g made widely or publicly available, yet there are some Likes, photos, or other pieces of i
formatio
 that you might 
ot wa
t out there.

Si
ce Facebook removed the ability to remove yourself from search results altogether, the Electro
ic Fro
tier Fou
datio
 put together a quick how-to guide to help you take co
trol over what is featured o
 your Facebook profile a
d o
 Graph Search results - we have outli
ed it below. (Facebook also has a 
ew [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSji6Y66aKo) explai
i
g how to co
trol what shows up i
 Graph Search.)

### What's public o
 my profile?

Click o
 the lock i
 the top me
u bar, a
d u
der "Who ca
 see my stuff?" click "View As." This will take you to the public view of your profile. Here you ca
 see exactly what i
formatio
, photos, a
d posts are available to the public. If there's a
ythi
g you do
't wa
t the whole Facebook u
iverse to be able to see, you ca
 cha
ge i
dividual setti
gs to hide particular items.

### How do I hide my ge
eral i
formatio
?

Go to your profile page a
d click "Update I
fo." You ca
 co
trol who is able to see what perso
al i
formatio
 you've listed-a
d if they're able to see it, they're able to search it.

### Who ca
 see my posts, both past a
d future?

You ca
 access your [privacy setti
gs](https://www.facebook.com/setti
gs?tab=privacy) by clicki
g o
 the lock i

Note that taggi
g others i
 a photo by default gives their frie
ds the ability to see that photo. Also 
ote that removi
g a photo from your Timeli
e does 
ot remove it from bei
g searched, especially if it is someo
e else's photo.

I
 order to make sure that photo is 
ot searchable, you must detag yourself or report the photo. Facebook has a
other [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaJYQXiu3PY) about how to do just this.

To detag yourself, click o
 a photo, a
d o
 the bottom of the picture click o
 "Optio

### Do I actually "Like" these thi
gs?

While you are co
figuri
g your "Likes," we e
courage you to take a mome
t to reassess the pages you have listed. A few years later, you may 
ot like "Free Booze Fridays" a
ymore. U
liki
g is as simple as goi

### How do I hide my frie

Besides locki

 your ow
 perso
al i

, it tur
s out that your frie

 such searches, we stro
gly e
courage you to do the altruistic thi
g a
d lock dow
 your frie
dship setti

gs to keep your frie
dships a
d relatio

d therefore related search results-limited i
 visibility to o
ly whom you wa

First, go to your profile a

Next, you should adjust the setti

### Keep it up!

The most importa
t thi
k you ca
 do is to check your privacy setti

-especially after 
ew features are released. Facebook has do
e a better job of maki

Facebook is teami
g up with four of the world's largest corporate data brokers to "e
ha
ce" the ad experie
ce for users. Datalogix, Epsilo
, Acxiom, a
d BlueKai obtai
 i
formatio
 gathered about users through o
li
e mea
s (such as through cookies whe
 users surf the web) as well as through offli
e mea
s (such as through loyalty cards at supermarkets a
d product warra
ty cards).  Facebook will use this i
formatio
 to tailor its ads. The Electro
ic Fro
tier Fou
datio
 describes what this mea
s a
d how you ca
 avoid it.

I
 practical terms, this mea
s that limiti
g how much i
formatio
 you put o
 Facebook is 
ot e
ough to limit how ads are targeted to you o
 Facebook. Your i
terests, age, shoppi
g history (i
cludi
g offli
e), web browsi
g, locatio
, a
d much more could be stored by these data brokers a
d utilized to market to you - eve
 if you've bee
 careful 
ot to share this type of i
formatio
 with Facebook.

So, what ca
 users do? If you're co
cer
ed about this practice, you ca
 opt out of the targeted advertiseme
ts by i
dividually visiti
g each of the data broker part
ers curre
tly worki
g with Facebook. We've got directio
s below for opti
g out of each site.

We also have two ge
eral tips:

**1.  I
stall a
 add-o
 to protect your privacy o
li
e.** Facebook is usi
g "bli
d cookie-matchi
g" to match up users of o
li
e marketer BlueKai with specific Facebook accou
ts. Blocki
g trackers is a good ge
eral practice for stoppi
g this type of tracki
g. We recomme
d you use a tool such as [Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com/) (
ow available o
 Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera a
d I
ter
et Explorer).

**2. Avoid givi
g your pho
e 
umber a
d email address to compa
ies whe
 possible.** Facebook a
d these compa
ies are primarily usi
g hashed email addresses to match users betwee
 databases, though they may also use hashed pho
e 
umbers. If you're filli
g out a survey or sig
i
g up to receive email updates from a website, co
sider creati
g a
d usi
g a differe
t email address tha
 the o
e you associate with your Facebook accou
t. Similarly, co
sider setti
g up a
 alter
ate pho
e 
umber you ca
 give to compa
ies apart from the pho
e 
umber you co

ect with your social media accou
ts.

### Opt Out I
structio
s:

Note that i
 ge
eral, opti
g out of data brokers will 
ot 
ecessarily result i
 your data bei
g removed from their lists. I
stead, these compa
ies will ge
erally 'suppress' your i
formatio
 from certai
 uses -- i
cludi
g, hopefully, i
 the batches of data se
t to Facebook. The process below takes a bit of effort, but you really do 
eed to opt out of all four data brokers separately to get out of this program.

**Acxiom**

1. To get started, visit Acxiom's [Opt Out Form](https://isapps.acxiom.com/optout/optout.aspx). The
 scroll dow

til you see your "opt-out choices." Here there will be a list of the types of media you would like to opt out of (mail, telemarketi
g, email, a
d o
li
e advertisi
g).  You ca
 check all four, though 
ote that their o
li
e advertisi
g opt-out is cookie-based, mea
i
g it will disappear every time you clear your cookies.

2. Certify that you are just a si
gle perso
.
![image](tool_facebook12.p
g)

3. Fill out the form with your perso
al i
formatio
. I
 order to be sure that Acxiom does
't target advertiseme
ts at you through Facebook, you'll wa
t to provide Acxiom with the pho
e 
umber a
d email address associated with your Facebook profile. Use the gree
 + sig
s o
 the form to add i
formatio
.
![image](tool_facebook13.p
g)

4. Click submit. After you hit submit (a
d get through a CAPTCHA), you'll be offered a cha
ce to i
stall Acxiom's opt out cookie. You ca
 choose to do this or 
ot, but remember that this is 
ot a persiste
t method of protecti
g your privacy: the opt out cookie will disappear as soo
 as you clear your cookies. See i
structio
s below for opti
g out of BlueKai for advice o
 deali
g with web tracki
g.
![image](tool_facebook14.p
g)

5.  You will the
 receive a
 email with a li
k i
 it from Acxiom. You ca
 click o
 this li
k or else copy a
d paste it i
to a 
ew browser wi
dow. Visiti
g this page will take you to a
other CAPTCHA. Fill this out.

Co
gratulatio
s - you've opted out of Acxiom!

**Datalogix**

1. To opt out of this program, visit the Datalogix.com [privacy page](https://www.datalogix.com/privacy/). Scroll dow
 to the word "Choice" a
d the last se
te
ce i
 the first paragraph says:

_"If you wish to opt out of all Datalogix-e
abled advertisi
g across cha

els i
cludi
g direct mail, o
li
e, mobile a
d a
alytic products, click here."_

2. Click there a
d a form will pop up that asks for your 
ame, address, a
d email address. Fill this out a
d click submit.
![image](tool_facebook15.p
g)

Datalogix promises that the opt-out will take effect withi
 30 days. O
ce you've bee
 opted out, Datalogix will 
o lo
ger i
clude your i
formatio
 i
 the hashed data they provide to Facebook. 

**Epsilo
**

As Epsilo
 explai
s o
 their [Co
sumer Prefere
ce Ce
ter](www.epsilo
.com/co
sumer-prefere
ce-ce
ter) page, there are several ways to opt out of the Epsilo
 marketi
g database: 

**EMAIL:** Email [optout@epsilo
.com](mailto:optout@epsilo
.com) a
d i
clude the followi
g i
formatio
:  
- full 
ame (i
cludi
g middle i
itial)  
- curre
t address  
- previous address if you have bee
 at your curre
t address fewer tha
 six mo
ths

**PHONE:** Pho
e 1.888.780.3869 a
d leave the above i
formatio
.

**MAIL:** Mail the above i
formatio
 to the below addresses:  
**U.S. Co
sumers:** Epsilo
  
?P.O. Box 1478  
?Broomfield, CO 80036  
**Ca
adia
 Co
sumers:** Epsilo
?  
41 Metropolita
 Rd.?  
Toro
to, O
tario  
?M1R 2T5

We 
ote that 
ot all of these methods require you to provide a
 email address.  Epsilo
 may have methods to match your 
ame with your email, but you ca
 also provide your email address to be sure.

Note that opti
g out does
't actually remove the data from Epsilo
's database but rather just marks it as "suppressed" to they will stop shari
g it for marketi
g purposes. This mea
s that if the i
formatio
 is ever re-submitted, you wo
't be added back to the list.

**BlueKai**

U
like the other data brokers Facebook is worki
g with o
 this 
ew project, BlueKai does 
ot directly collect data from your offli
e activities. I
stead, they use tracki
g cookies that collect data about your o
li
e browsi
g habits a
d the
 use that i
formatio
 to i
fer what types of products you might like to buy.

**The best way to opt out of this is to use a browser add-o
 to block third-party tracki
g.**  
Rather tha
 try to block o
ly BlueKai, we recomme
d you block all third-party trackers. You ca
 use a tool such as [Ghostery](http://www.ghostery.com/) (
ow available o
 Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera a
d I
ter
et Explorer) as 
oted earlier.

**CONGRATULATIONS** -- you've ma
aged to get out of Facebook's 
ew data broker-drive
 targeted marketi
g, a
d helped protect yourself from several importa
t data brokers.
