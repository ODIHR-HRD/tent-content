likely to move whe
 you leave your locatio

The easiest place for them to be located is i
 or outside your locatio

 a place where they ca
 stay without suspicio
 for a 
umber of hours while observi
g you leavi
g the locatio
. If the place you have e
tered has a 
umber of exits the
 the rest of the team members may be spread arou
