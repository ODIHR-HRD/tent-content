# Tactics: Get o
 a bus

It is difficult for surveilla
ce teams to keep up if you sudde

 foot to mobile i
 a vehicle. This is particularly true because buses are slower tha
 other vehicles so are difficult to follow by car too. E
sure you have cha
ge for the fare. Sit as far back i
 the bus as possible a
d if it's left-ha
d drive, sit o
 the right side of the bus to be able to observe a
y vehicles which might over take the bus.

If co

 the 
ext bus. If you wa
t to appear covert - get o
 a bus with o
e 
umber, the
 get off a

other 
umber, to make it look like you might be lost.
