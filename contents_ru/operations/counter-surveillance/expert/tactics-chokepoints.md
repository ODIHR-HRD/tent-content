If usi

dabout as a chokepoi
t, try to record up to 10 of the vehicles followi
g the vehicle which is pote
tially u
der surveilla
ce  - Try to 
ote the registratio
 a
d descriptio
 (colour, make, model, u
ique descriptive features, 
umber of occupa
ts, prese
ce of radios etc.) This is because a ha
dover to a
other car may take place here - so a
other perso
