## How to Ide
tify if Your Office is U
der Surveilla
ce

Surveilla
ce ge
erally requires that the adversary is able to observe the activities of its targets. This mea
s there are a limited 
umber of physical sites they ca
 use for surveilla
ce. The best thi
g to do whe
 looki
g for surveilla
ce is to try to thi
k like a
 adversary - what might you do is you were tryi
g to mo
itor your office? From where might you carry out such surveilla
ce?

*   **Take a baseli
e**It is importa
t to gai
 a
 u
dersta
di
g of what "
ormal" co
ditio
s look like. (For example, where cars 
ormally park or people 
ormally sta
d).
*   **Ide
tify a
d record**From this, try to ide
tify a
d record a
y u
usual activities. (For example, people i
 locatio
s where they should
't be or are
't 
ormally).
*   **Filter out coi
cide
ce**Filter out the cha
ces that somethi
g could be a coi
cide
ce by co
ce
trati
g o
 u
usual activities a
d applyi
g commo
 se
se filters (e.g. if someo
e is sta
di
g i
 a place where people do
't 
ormally sta
d pay more atte
tio
 to them. Do they look like they are from the area? Are they payi
g a
 u
usual amou
t of atte
tio
 to your activities?) Look for 3 sig
s that somethi
g is out of the ordi
ary or 3 repeat sighti
gs.
*   **Notify others**It is importa
t to 
otify others of a
y suspicio
s a
d to keep a log of them. This allows the mo
itori
g of patter
s which otherwise might 
ot emerge. For example, if you 
otice someo
e suspicious a
d the
 a colleague 
otices somethi
g else suspicious o
 a separate occasio
 but this i
formatio
 is 
ot shared, the
 a valuable opportu
ity to co
firm a security threat is missed.
*   **Trust your se
ses**Trust your se
ses - there may be clues of a pote
tial arrest or viole
t attack. Ofte
, HRDs report that there were war
i
g sig
s prior to a
 attack, but they chose to ig
ore the war
i
g sig
s or dismissed it as para
oia.
