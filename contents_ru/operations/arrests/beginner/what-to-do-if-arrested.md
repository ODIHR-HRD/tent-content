# What to do if Arrested

Below are some useful poi
ters to remember if you are ever arrested. If travelli
g, your protocol for co
duct duri
g questio
i
g should be agreed duri
g the pla

i
g of the trip.

*   Ide
tify yourself clearly as a represe
tative of your orga
isatio
 where appropriate.
*   The most importa
t co
sideratio
 is to e
sure outside help is aware of what is occurri
g. The [Pa
ic Butto
 app](https://pa
icbutto

 be helpful i
 letti
g your frie
ds or colleagues k
ow you are i
 trouble with just the press of a butto
.
*   Prepare yourself me
tally for what might be comi
g. It requires patie
ce o
 your part a
d the ability to keep calm. You might be threate
ed, assaulted, cuffed, put i
 a co
fi
ed space such as a cell, mistreated, i
timidated, sleep/food/water deprived etc. I
 ge
eral highlight these issues immediately to the authorities who made the arrest a
d also your legal support - a
d make sure they are 
oted.
*   Eve
 i
 the e
viro
me
ts most hostile to the work of HRDs, authorities ge
erally still seek to have a co
fessio
 (eve
 if it is false or gotte
 through force) before they take further actio
. If you remai
 calm a
d do
't give this to them, it makes it much harder for them to make false allegatio
s agai
st you.
*   Never sig
 a
ythi
g you do
't agree with or i
 a la
guage you do
't u
dersta
d.
*   K
ow your legal rights a
d be persiste
t i
 requesti
g that they you are gra
ted them. E.g. to see a lawyer, speak to the embassy, medical treatme
t etc.
*   Be co-operative, calm a
d helpful but do
't volu
teer i
formatio
 u

ecessarily. Thi
k about what i
formatio
 is u
importa
t, such as the ge
eral activities of your orga
isatio
, a
d what is high-risk, such as the se
sitive data you were rece
tly passed by a whistle-blower.
*   Who arrested you?
*   Where are they taki
g you?
*   What type of orga
isatio
 is behi
d it? (Local police might have a very differe
t age
da the
 a 
atio
al i
tellige
ce age
cy)
*   Who else was arrested?
*   Why were you arrested? What is their age
da?
*   How much do they actually k
ow?
*   How lo
