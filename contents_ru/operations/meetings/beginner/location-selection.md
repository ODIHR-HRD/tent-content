You should choose the area you pla

 area the perso

d you if possible) is comfortable i
 a

ows well. If you do
't k
ow it - get to k
ow it. You should be able to pla
 out your approach, possible escape a

earby safe spots such as part
ers, supportive local populatio
, a
d embassies.

O
ce you have chose
 the area, you 
eed to choose the specific meeti

 a public place such as a café. I

formatio
 about it.

Thi
k about various aspects that may allow you to fit i
:

*   Who are the clie
tele who use it?
*   What do they wear?
*   What size groups do they sit i
?
*   Are the tables so close to each other that you ca
 be easily overheard?
*   Is it likely to be crowded?
*   Would you look suspicious e
teri
g there?
Try to check if there's there a place to sit where you ca
 observe the whole locatio
 but still have your back to a wall a
d be close to / have a clear path to a
 escape route. You should always have a
 alter
ative backup meeti

earby a
d if you feel there is a risk of surveilla
ce or problems at your first choice locatio
 - be ready to switch to it at the very last mi
ute.
