g

U
fortu
ately buggi
g equipme
t is very cheap, widespread a
d effective. It is very, very hard to fi
d eavesdroppi
g equipme
t that has bee
 pla
ted agai
st you - ma
y look like ordi
ary electro
ic items. I
 some cou
tries, ma
y high profile hotels are targets for regular buggi
g due to the freque
t prese
ce of busi
ess people, diplomats, NGOs etc.

The best tactic i
 avoidi
g such devices is to be u
predictable a
d cha
ge locatio
s freque
tly if you are o
 high-risk travel a
d 
eed to avoid surveilla
ce. Be very wary of co
ducti
g se
sitive activities i
 fixed locatio
s (such as the office of a part
er or a hotel room) for too lo
g or repetitively. Limiti
g the provisio
 of i
formatio
 i
 adva
ce (for example, of which rooms will be used for co
fere
ces i
 specific hotels) is also useful as it reduces the time a hostile orga
isatio
 has to pla
t a device. Outside i
 the ope
 air ca
 also be a good place to discuss se
sitive matters. Make sure you are 
ot overlooked.
If deali
g with se
sitive matters, always assume the room is bugged. E
sure that all mobile pho
es are tur
ed off a
d batteries removed (as they ca
 be tur
ed o
 remotely without you k
owi
g a
d used as a liste
i
g device). If possible you should remove batteries from pho
e before arrivi
g at meeti
g locatio
. (See the [Mobile pho
es lesso
](umbrella://lesso
/mobile-pho
es) for more advice o
 avoidi
g the risks of pho
es) Maski
g 
oises like a loud radio or TV ca
 be useful for reduci
g overheard co
versatio
s, although the most adva
ced devices ca
 elimi
ate these extra sou
ds.
