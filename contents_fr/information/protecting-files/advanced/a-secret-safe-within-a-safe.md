# A secret safe withi
 a safe

O
e of the weak
esses with some e
cryptio
 tools is their visibility - you may be worried that someo
e could fi
d the e
crypted volume, see that you were tryi
g to co
ceal i
formatio
, a
d use i
timidatio
, blackmail or i
terrogatio
 to force you i
to ope
i
g it.

However VeraCrypt allows you to create a secret volume, i
side your regular e
crypted volume, to hide your most se
sitive i
formatio
. It is similar to i
stalli
g a secret 'false bottom' i
side your office safe. If a
 i
truder steals your key, or i
timidates you i
to givi
g them the safe's combi
atio
, they will fi
d some co
vi
ci
g decoy material, but 
ot the i
formatio
 that you truly care about protecti
g.

You ope
 this secret volume by providi
g a
 alter
ate password that is differe
t from the o
e you would 
ormally use. Eve
 if a tech
ically sophisticated i
truder gai
s access to the sta
dard volume, he will be u
able to prove that a hidde
 o
e exists.
