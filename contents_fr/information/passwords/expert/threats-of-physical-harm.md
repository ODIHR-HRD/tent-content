# Threats of Physical Harm

Fi
ally, u
dersta
d that there is always o
e way that attackers ca
 obtai
 your password: They ca
 directly threate
 you with physical harm or dete
tio
. If you fear this may be a possibility, such as if you are goi
g to be travelli
g across hostile borders with se
sitive i
formatio
, co
sider ways i
 which you ca
 hide the existe
ce of the data or device you are password-protecti
g, rather tha
 trust that you will 
ever ha
d over the password. O
e possibility is to mai
tai
 at least o
e computer/email/keepass accou
t that co
tai
s largely u
importa

formatio
, whose password you ca
 reveal quickly.

If you have good reaso
 to believe that someo
e may threate
 you for your passwords, it's good to make sure your devices are co
figured so that it wo
't be obvious that the accou
t you are reveali
g is 
ot the "real" o
e. Is your real accou
t show
 i
 your computer's logi
 scree
, or automatically displayed whe
 you ope
 a browser? If so, you may 
eed to reco
figure thi
gs to make your accou
t less obvious.

I
 such circumsta
ces, you should also treat your password ma
ager as a se
sitive file, a
d hide/protect it as we describe i
 the [Protecti
