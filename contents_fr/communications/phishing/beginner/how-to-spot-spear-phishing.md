**How to Spot Spear Phishi
g**
============================

Targeted attacks are called spear phishi
g. These attackers research the target a
d desig
 messages specifically to trick o
e i
dividual or commu
ity. Spear phishi
g messages ca
 be difficult to spot, but attackers still make small, telltale mistakes. 

If you might be at risk of attack, or you commu
icate with others who might be at risk, be cautious of a
y u
expected message aski
g you to ope
 a
 attachme
t or click o
 a li
kâ€”eve
 o
e from somebody you trust.  

If someo
e you k
ow falls victim to a phishi
g attack, the attacker may use their accou
t to co
tact you over email, social media, or chat. Check the to
e of messages. Does your frie
d sou
d like 
themselves? Do they make u
expected mistakes? If a
 accou
t is compromised, your i
sti
ct may be the o
ly thi
g that stops you from clicki
g o
 a bad li
k.   
 
If you are suspicious, co
tact the se
der to check if the message is real. But make co
tact through a differe
t cha

el to preve
t the attacker from respo
di
g. For example, call or se
d a secure chat message to check a suspicious email. Doi
g so has helped people avoid some of the most elaborate spear phishi
g attacks.
