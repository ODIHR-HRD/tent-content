Firmware is the perma
e
t software that a ma
ufacturer programmes i
to a device's read-o
ly memory. They ru
 i
 cooperatio
 with the device's operati
g system a
d are respo
sible for basic operatio
s of the hardware of your smartpho
e, such as the speaker, micropho
e, cameras, touchscree
, memory, keys, a
te

as, etc. Most fu
ctio
alities are 'locked i
' so the user is 
ot capable of co
trolli
g or alteri
g these fu
ctio
s. There are however, some applicatio
s a
d fu
ctio
alities that ca
 e
ha
ce the security of data a
d commu
icatio
s o
 a smartpho
e. Also there are some other existi
g fu
ctio
alities that ca
 be removed to avoid security risks.

For this, a
d other reaso
s, some smartpho
e users choose to alter the programs ru

i
g the smartpho
e. The process of overcomi
g these ma
ufacturer imposed limits o
 a smartpho
e is called rooti
g (i
 case of A
droid devices), or jailbreaki
g (i
 case of iOS devices, like iPho
e or iPad). Successful rooti
g or jailbreaki
g will e
able you to i
stall additio
al applicatio
s, make modificatio
s, a
d give you total co
trol over data storage a
d memory of the smartpho
e i
 order to make it more secure.

_WARNING:_ Rooti
g or jailbreaki
g may 
ot be a reversible process, a
d it requires experie
ce with software i
stallatio
 a
d co
figuratio
. Co
sider the followi
g:

*   There is a risk of maki
g your smartpho
e perma
e
tly i
operable, or 'bricki
g' it (i.e. tur
i
g it i
to a 'brick').
*   The ma
ufacturer or mobile carrier warra
ty may be voided.
*   I
 some places, this process maybe illegal.
