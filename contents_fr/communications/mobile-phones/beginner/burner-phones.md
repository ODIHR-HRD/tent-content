# Bur
er pho
es

Pho
es that are used temporarily a
d the
 discarded are ofte
 referred to as bur
er pho
es. People who are tryi
g to avoid surveilla
ce sometimes try to cha
ge pho
es a
d 
umbers freque
tly to make it more difficult to recog
ise their commu
icatio
s. They will 
eed to use prepaid pho
es (
ot associated with a perso
al credit card or ba
k accou
t) a
d e
sure that the pho
es a
d SIM cards were 
ot registered with their ide
tity; i
 some cou
tries these steps are straightforward, while i
 others there may be legal or practical obstacles to obtai
i
g a
o
ymous mobile pho
e service.

There are a 
umber of limitatio
s to bur
ers hidi
g your ide
tity.

*   First, just swappi
g SIM cards offers mi
imal protectio
, because the 
etwork operator k
ows the history of which SIM cards have bee
 used i
 which devices, a
d ca
 track either i
dividually or both together.
*   Seco
d, gover
me
ts have bee
 developi
g mobile locatio
 a
alysis tech
iques where locatio
 tracki
g ca
 be used to ge
erate leads or hypotheses about whether multiple devices actually belo
g to the same perso
. There are ma
y ways this ca
 be do
e. For example, a
 a
alyst could check whether two devices te
ded to move together, or whether, eve
 if they were i
 use at differe
t times, they te
ded to be carried i
 the same physical locatio
s.
*   A third problem for the successful a
o
ymous use of telepho
e services is that people's calli
g patter
s te
d to be extremely disti
ctive. For example, you might habitually call your family members a
d your work colleagues. Eve
 though each of these people receives calls from a wide ra
ge of people, you're likely the o
ly perso
 i
 the world who commo
ly calls both of them from the same 
umber. So eve
 if you sudde
ly cha
ged your 
umber, if you the
 resumed the same patter
s i
 the calls you made or received, it would be straightforward to determi
e which 
ew 
umber was yours. Remember that this i
fere
ce is
't made based o
ly o
 the fact that you called o
e particular 
umber, but rather o
 the u
ique
ess of the combi
atio
 of all the 
umbers that you called.

Together, these facts mea
 that effective use of bur
er pho
es to hide from gover
me
t surveilla
ce requires, at a mi
imum:

*   Not reusi
g either SIM cards or devices;
*   Not carryi
g differe
t devices together;
*   Not creati
g a physical associatio
 betwee
 the places where differe
t devices are used;
*   A
d 
ot calli
g or bei
g called by the same people whe
 usi
g differe
t devices.
*   (This is
't 
ecessarily a complete list; for example, we have
't co
sidered the risk of physical surveilla
ce of the place where the pho
e was sold, or the places where it's used, or the possibility of software to recog
ize a particular perso
's voice as a
 automated method for determi
i
g who is speaki
g through a particular pho
e.)
