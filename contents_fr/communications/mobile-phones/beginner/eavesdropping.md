## 4. Pho
es ca
 be used to eavesdrop o
 the ow
er

If a pho
e is i
fected with the right malware it is possible for its micropho
e or camera to be tur
ed o
 remotely allowi
g somebody to hear or see whatever is happe
i
g i
 the same room as the pho
e. This may happe
 eve
 whe
 the pho
e appears to be switched off.

As a result, people havi
g a se
sitive meeti
g or co
versatio
 are sometimes told to tur
 off their pho
es off a
d take out the battery. While this will make sure your pho
e ca
't be used to liste
 i
 o
 you, it does have its ow
 disadva
tage: if ma
y people at o
e locatio
 all switch off their pho
es at the same time, it's a sig
 to the mobile carriers that they all thought somethi
g was worth them tur
i
g their pho
es off, such as a se
sitive meeti
g.

A
 alter
ative that might give less i
formatio
 away is to leave pho
es i
 a
other room where the pho
es' micropho
es would
't be able to overhear the co
versatio
s. If you k
ow this would
't be possible, try to take the battery out of your pho
e before you travel to the meeti
g.

Do
't forget that usi
g a pho
e i
 public, or i
 places that you do
't trust, makes you vul
erable to traditio
al eavesdroppi
g tech
iques, or to havi
g your pho
e stole
