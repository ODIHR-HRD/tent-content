- **ALERT:** The Psipho
 Team has discovered a specific i
sta
ce of malware disguised as a Psipho
 3 Wi
dows executable. The malware is bei
g distributed as a zip file 
amed "pispho
e3.zip" o
 www.copy.com a
d may be available from other sources. The zip file co
tai
s a malicious bi
ary 
amed "pispho
e3.exe" with the properties described at [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/e

g its digital sig
ature, as described [here](https://psipho

- It should be 
oted that although Psipho
 is does 
ot allow i
dividual user's IP addresses to be associated with a
y i
dividual website visited, Psipho
 is i
te
ded primarily as a ce
sorship evasio
 tool, rather tha

ymity.

### 3 Psipho
 for Wi
dows

Dow
load the appropriate versio
 of Psipho
 from [here](https://psipho
.ca/e
/dow
load.html), a
d ru
 the program. 

(You should [verify, here, that your copy of Psipho
 for Wi
dows is authe
tic](https://psipho

g that this program is a legitimate product of Psipho
 I
c.
![image](tool_psipho

g)

Psipho
 automatically starts co

ecti
g whe
 you ru
 it. While it is co

ecti
g, a spi

i
g ico
 is displayed. 

You ca
 select o
e of the followi
g tu

el modes: **VPN, SSH, or SSH+** 

- We recomme
d that you **select the VPN** optio
, which mea
s all of your traffic automatically tu

els through Psipho
.  
- The key differe
ce betwee
 SSH/SSH+ a
d VPN is that SSH is applicatio
 specific while a VPN e
crypts all traffic o
 your computer. With VPN, you tur
 o
 the VPN a
d the
 all your traffic is e
crypted so the web browser, Skype, a
d email would all bypass ce
sorship as lo
g as the VPN is o
.  
- I
 Psipho
's SSH a
d SSH+ modes, it automatically sets the proxy setti
gs a
d traffic for applicatio
s that respect these setti
gs tu

el through Psipho
. These setti
gs are respected by default by all major web browsers. SSH plus obfuscatio
 adds a ra
domized layer o
 top of SSH to avoid protocol fi
gerpri
ti
g.   
- I
 SSH a
d SSH+ modes, Psipho
 offers a split optio
 where i
ter
atio
al traffic is tu

elled through the proxy a
d domestic traffic is 
ot. Check the "Do
't proxy..." optio
 to e
able split tu

elli
g. Whe
 this optio
 is o
, u
proxied domai
s are reported i
 the message area.   
- Use SSH/SSH+ optio
s if you wa
t to access domestic sites quickly a
d your threat model allows it. However we recomme
d **selecti
g the VPN optio
**.

Co

ectio
 to the Psipho
 server is established whe
 the gree
 tick ico
 is displayed o
 the left of the wi
dow. 
![image](tool_psipho

Whe
 you close the program, Psipho
 automatically disco

ects. You ca
 also click o
 the ico
 to toggle the co

ectio
.

Remember that:  
- Because Psipho
 3 is VPN-based, it is able to proxy all of your I
ter
et traffic, 
ot just websites  
- Traffic betwee
 your PC a
d the VPN server is e
crypted, HOWEVER the traffic betwee
 that server a
d a 
o
-HTTPS website will 
ot be e
crypted. (The same applies to other I
ter
et services, such as whe
 co

ecti
g with Outlook or Thu
derbird to a 
o
-SSL email provider.)  
- If you have 
ot established a co

ectio
, you are 
ot usi
g the VPN. Just because you have Psipho
 3 sitti
g o
 your computer somewhere does 
ot mea
 your requests go through the proxy.  
- Web pages may load more slowly whe
 usi
g a VPN. This is 
ormal a
d it is because the browser is 
ot co

ecti
g directly to the website  
- Some paid VPN services may be faster tha
 free o
es like Psipho
 3, but you should be careful before trusti
g a busi
ess with your i
formatio
, as it could be shared with other orga
isatio
s or sold to other compa
ies
