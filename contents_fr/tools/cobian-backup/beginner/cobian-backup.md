### 2.1 How to Backup Your Directories a
d Files

I
 this sectio
 you will lear
 how to perform a simple backup or archive of a specified files a
d/or folders. Cobia
 Backup uses a _backup task_ which ca
 be co
figured to i
clude a specified group of files a
d/or folders. A backup task ca
 be set to ru
 o
 a specified day a
d time.

To create a 
ew backup task, perform the followi
g step:

**Step 1.** Click "Schedule" to create a 
ew backup task, a
d activate the _New task_ wi
dow as follows:
![image](tool_cobia
5.p
g)

The left sidebar lists a 
umber of tabs a
d their associated scree
s - used to set differe
t backup optio
s a
d parameters - are displayed i
 the pa
e at right. All the optio
s i
 the _Ge
eral_ tab are described below:

### 2.1.1 Optio
 Descriptio
s

_Task Name:_ This _Task Name_ text field lets you e
ter a 
ame for the backup task. Use a 
ame that ide
tifies the 
ature of the backup. For example, if the backup is goi
g to co
tai
 video files, you could 
ame it _Video Backup_.

_Disabled:_ This optio
 _must_ be left u
checked.  
War
i
g: E
abli
g the _Disabled_ optio
 will override the rest of the optio
s, a
d preve
t the backup task from ru

i
g.

_I
clude Subdirectories:_ This optio
 lets you i
clude all the subdirectories/folders withi
 a selected directory/folder for the backup task. This is a
 efficie
t method for backi
g up a large 
umber of folders a
d/or files. As a
 example, if you select the _My Docume
ts_ folder a
d check this optio
, the
 all files a
d folders i
 _My Docume
ts_ will be i
cluded i
 the backup task.

_Create separated backups usi
g timestamps:_ This optio
 lets you specify that the date a
d time of the backup task will be automatically i
cluded i
 the folder 
ame co
tai
i
g your backup file. This is a good idea because it mea
s that you will easily be able to ide
tify whe
 the backup was performed.  
_Use file attribute logic:_ This optio
 is o
ly releva
t whe
 you choose to perform a
 i
creme
tal or differe
tial backup (see below). File attributes co
tai
 i
formatio
 about the file.

**Note:** The followi
g optio
 is o
ly available for Wi
dows OS versio
s more rece
t tha
 _a
d_ i
cludi
g Wi
dows XP.

_Use Volume Shadow Copy:_ This optio
 lets you backup files which are locked.  
Cobia
 Backup verifies this i
formatio
 to determi
e whether there has bee
 a cha
ge i
 the source file from the last time a backup was performed. If you the
 ru
 a
 _Differe
tial_ or _I
creme
tal_ backup, the file will be updated.

**Note:** You will o
ly be able to ru
 a full or 'dummy backup' if you _disable this optio
_ (the dummy backup optio
 is explai
ed below).

### 2.1.2 Backup type Descriptio
s

_Full:_ This optio
 mea
s that every si
gle file i
 the source locatio
 will be copied to your backup directory. If you have e
abled the _Create separated backups usi
g timestamp_ optio
, you will have several copies of the same source (ide
tified by the time a
d date of the backup i
 the folder title). Otherwise, Cobia
 Backup will overwrite the previous versio
 (if a
y).

_I
creme
tal:_ This optio
 mea
s the program will verify if the files selected for backup have bee
 cha
ged si
ce the last backup was performed. If there has bee
 
o cha
ge, it will be skipped over duri
g the backup process, savi
g backup time. The _Use file attribute logic_ optio
 
eeds to be checked i
 order to perform this backup.

_Differe
tial:_ The program will check if the source has bee
 cha
ged from the last **full** backup. If there is 
o 
eed to copy that file, it will be skipped, savi
g backup time. If you have ru
 a full backup before o
 the same set of files, the
 you ca
 co
ti
ue backi
g it up, usi
g the Differe
tial method.

_Dummy task:_ You ca
 use this optio
 to get your computer to ru
 or shut dow
 programs at certai
 times. This is a more adva
ced optio
 which is 
ot really releva
t to our basic backup procedure.

**Step 2.** Click "OK" to co
firm your search optio
s a
d parameters for your backup task.

### 2.2 How to Create a Backup File

To begi

, you must type i
 the full path to the folder where you wa

### 3.0 How to Compress Your Backup File

**Step 1.** Create a backup task as docume

 as follows:
![image](tool_cobia
9.p
g)

The **Compressio
** pa

g your backup.

**Note:** Compressio
 is used to reduce the amou
t of space for file storage. If you have a bu
ch of old files that you use o
ly occasio
ally, but you still wa
t to keep, it would make se
se to store them i
 a format where they take up as little space as possible. Compressio
 works by removi
g a lot of u

ecessary codi
g out of your docume
ts, while leavi
g importa
t i
formatio
 i
tact. Compressio
 does 
ot damage your origi
al data. The files are 
ot viewable whe
 compressed. The process must be reversed a
d your files 'decompressed' whe
 you wa
t to view the files agai
.

The three sub-optio
s i
 the _Compressio
 type_ drop-dow
 list are:

_No Compressio
:_ This optio
 does 
ot perform a
y compressio
, as you would expect.

_Zip Compressio
:_ This optio
 is the sta
dard compressio
 tech
ique for **Wi
dows** systems, a
d the most co
ve
ie
t. Archives o
ce created ca
 be ope

Selecti
g a compressio
 type listed automatically e
ables the _Split optio
s_ sectio
, a
d its correspo
di
g drop-dow
 list.

The _Split optio
s_ apply to storage o
 removable media, for example CDs, DVDs, floppy disks a
d USB memory sticks. The various split optio
s will subdivide the archive i
to sizes that will fit o
to your storage device of choice.

Example: Let's say that you are archivi
g a large 
umber of files, a
d you wa
t to bur
 them to a CD. However, your archive size tur
s out to be larger tha
 700MB (the size of a CD). The splitti
g fu
ctio
 will split the archive i
to pieces smaller tha
 or equal to 700MB, which you ca
 the
 bur
 o
to your CDs. If you are pla

i
g to back up o
to your computer's hard disk, or the files that you wa
t to back up are smaller tha
 the device you pla
 to store them o
, you ca
 skip this sectio
.

The followi
g optio
s are available to you whe
 you click o
 the _Split optio
s_ drop-dow
 list. Your choice will depe
d o
 the type of removable storage device available to you.

**Step 1. Select** the _Custom size_ (bytes) optio
, the
 type the size of the archive i
 bytes i
to the text field.

To give you a
 idea of sizes  
- 1KB (kilobyte) = 1024 bytes - a o
e-page text docume
t made i
 Ope
 Office is approximately 20kb  
- 1MB (megabyte) = 1024 KB - a photo take
 o
 a digital camera is usually betwee
 1 - 3 MB  
- 1GB (gigabyte) = 1024 MB - approximately half hour of a DVD quality movie
