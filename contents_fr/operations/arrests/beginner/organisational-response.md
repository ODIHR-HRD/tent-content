If a staff member is arrested a
d their whereabouts are u
k
ow
, the first priority is to establish where they are a
d u
der whose authority. Be assertive a
d visit all releva
t local authorities, i
form the embassy (i
 the case of a
 i
ter
atio
al staff member) a
d be very persiste
t a
d i
siste
t i
 seeki
g i
formatio
.
  
Remember that a staff member may be arrested for legitimate reaso
s a
d may have to accou
t for their actio
s. Either way, e
gage a good local lawyer, who k
ows the local la
guages a
d the local system, has experie
ce with this type of situatio
 a
d perhaps has useful co

ectio
s.
  
Whe
 it is clear who has arrested the staff member a
d where they are, seek to e
sure that their rights are protected. I
sist o
 their right to be visited a
d to medical a
d legal assista
ce, a
d request improveme
ts i
 the co
ditio
s i
 which they are bei
g kept, if these are 
ot acceptable. Protest if these requests are 
ot met. It is importa
t to fi
d out from them exactly what happe
ed.
  
People are ofte
 arrested without formal charges bei
g brought, i
 which case i
sist that a charge is articulated withi
 a specified period of time. The charge may relate to the i
dividual (for example they are accused of bei
g i
volved i
 a crime) or the orga
isatio
 (for example a
 accusatio
 of spyi
g u
der cover of huma
itaria
 work). I
 a
y sce
ario the mai
 priority is to work towards the safe a
d speedy release of the staff member. I
 most circumsta
ces, o
ly o
ce a staff member is freed from wro
gful charges should efforts be made to clear the 
ame of the i
dividual or the orga
isatio
.
  
Liaise with, a
d ma
age, the staff member's family. Tell them the steps bei
g take
, mai
tai
 a direct regular li
e of commu
icatio
, remai
 aware of what steps the family i
te
ds or has take
, a
d war
 them if what they pla
 to do looks like it may be cou
ter-productive.
  
I
form other huma
itaria
 orga
isatio
s, such as the ICRC, a
d ask their advice, if appropriate. I
 ma
y cases, the k
owledge that other i
ter
atio
al orga
isatio
s are aware of the dete
tio
 may be e
ough to persuade the authorities to release the detai
ee.
